Dr. Peale's groundbreaking program of affirmation and positive visualization is an amazingly effective way to overcome any obstacles that may stand between you and success, happiness, and your mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual health and well-being. Positive Thinking works - and in <i>The Power of Positive Living</i>, Dr. Peale demonstrates how to use these techniques to conquer the fears and crippling adversity that may be holding you back from realizing your true potential in life. Self-confidence is the key, and this audiobook shows us how we can do it! With the \"get-it-done twins\", patience and perseverance, any believer can be an achiever! </p><p>Dr. Peale provides inspiring success stories from his own extensive experience as a counselor - such as a department store executive who turned his store into one of the chain's most profitable by focusing on his past successes rather than his failures and a woman who recovered her self-confidence and joy and purpose in living when she started volunteering with cancer survivors after her own breast cancer diagnosis cut short her modeling career. The wisdom, guidance, and practical advice provided in <i>The Power of Positive Living</i> will give you faith in yourself and in your power to achieve absolutely anything! </p>";
