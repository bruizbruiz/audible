When the Las Vegas native was just 19, she contracted bacterial meningitis and was given less than a two percent chance of survival. Her glimpse of the afterlife - coupled with a mysterious premonition she'd had a month before - became the defining experiences that put Amy's life on a new trajectory after her legs had to be amputated. She wouldn't just beat meningitis and walk again; she would go on to create a life filled with bold adventures, big dreams, and boundless vitality - and share that spirit with the world. In 2014 Amy - the only competitor, male or female, with two prosthetic legs - claimed a bronze medal for the US Paralympic team in adaptive snowboarding. She then became a contestant on season 18 of <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>, and viewers were captivated as the girl with bionic legs managed to out-dance her competitors all the way to the finale. </p> <p>Amy's journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity we all have to dream bigger, defy expectations, and rewrite our stories. Amy was given a second chance for a reason - to use her life to inspire others. Her powerful memoir urges us to live life to the fullest, because we are all a lot more capable than we could ever imagine.</p>";
