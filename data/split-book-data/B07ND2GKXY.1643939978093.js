The first book in the series is Mark Twain’s <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, performed by Elijah Wood.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ernest Hemingway said, “All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>\". One hundred years after its author’s death, this classic remains remarkably modern and poignantly relevant. In this edition, Elijah Wood reads Huck in a youthful voice that may be the closest interpretation to Twain’s original intent. His performance captures the excitement and confusion of adolescence and adventure. Best of all, the immediacy of Wood’s energetic reading sweeps listeners up and makes them feel as though they’re along for the ride, as Huck and Jim push their raft toward freedom.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stay tuned for more one-of-a-kind performances from actors Kenneth Branagh, David Hyde Pierce, Leelee Sobieski, and more, only from Audible Signature Classics.</p>";
