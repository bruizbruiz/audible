Modern audiences, critics, and directors seem better attuned to its delicate counter pointing of romance and realism, to its ambivalent ending, and to the poetic suggestiveness of Feste's songs.</p><p>With this in mind, sit back and enjoy this lively performance, featuring the voices of such esteemed Shakespearean actors as Stella Gonet (Viola) and Gerard Murphy (Sir Toby Belch), accompanied by a full cast. </p>";
