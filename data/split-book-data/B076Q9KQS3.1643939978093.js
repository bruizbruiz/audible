window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This masterpiece of science (and mathematical) fiction is a delightfully unique and highly entertaining satire that has charmed audiences for more than 100 years. The work of English clergyman, educator, and Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the journeys of A. Square, a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women - thin, straight lines - are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status. </p> <p>Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions - a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world. </p> <p><i>Flatland</i> is not only fascinating listening, it is still a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space.</p>";
