window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“If you've been looking for something different to level up your health, fitness, and personal growth,&nbsp;</b><b><i>this is it</i></b><b>.” (Melissa Urban, Whole30 CEO and&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;best-selling author)</b></p> <p><b>Discover the evolutionary mind and body benefits of living at the edges of your comfort zone and reconnecting with the wild.</b></p> <p>In many ways, we’re more comfortable than ever before. But could our sheltered, temperature-controlled, overfed, underchallenged lives actually be the leading cause of many our most urgent physical and mental health issues? In this gripping investigation, award-winning journalist Michael Easter seeks out off-the-grid visionaries, disruptive genius researchers, and mind-body conditioning trailblazers who are unlocking the life-enhancing secrets of a counterintuitive solution: discomfort.</p> <p>Easter’s journey to understand our evolutionary need to be challenged takes him to meet the NBA’s top exercise scientist, who uses an ancient Japanese practice to build championship athletes; to the mystical country of Bhutan, where an Oxford economist and Buddhist leader are showing the world what death can teach us about happiness; to the outdoor lab of a young neuroscientist who’s found that nature tests our physical and mental endurance in ways that expand creativity while taming burnout and anxiety; to the remote Alaskan backcountry on a demanding 33-day hunting expedition to experience the rewilding secrets of one of the last rugged places on Earth; and more.</p> <p>Along the way, Easter uncovers a blueprint for leveraging the power of discomfort that will dramatically improve our health and happiness, and perhaps even help us understand what it means to be human.&nbsp;<i>The Comfort Crisis</i>&nbsp;is a bold call to break out of your comfort zone and explore the wild within yourself.</p>";
