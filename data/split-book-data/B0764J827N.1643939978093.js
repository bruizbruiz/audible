window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the spirit of Piri Thomas' <i>Down These Mean Streets</i> and Maya Angelou's <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i>, this powerful memoir by writer and activist Kevin Powell vividly recounts the horrific poverty of his youth; his struggles to overcome a legacy of anger, violence, and self-hatred; and his journey to be a man and a voice for others. </p><p>Driven by his single mother's dreams for his survival and success, Kevin Powell became the first in his family to attend a university, where he became a student leader keenly aware of widespread social injustice. But the struggle to define himself and break out of poverty continued into adulthood, with traumatic periods of homelessness and despair. As a young star journalist with <i>Vibe</i> magazine, Powell interviewed luminaries such as Tupac Shakur, writing influential chronicles of the evolution of hip-hop from his eyewitness view. Now, with searing honesty, Powell examines his troubled relationships, his appearance on MTV's first season of <i>The Real World</i>, his battles with alcohol and depression, his two campaigns for Congress, and the uplifting trip to Africa that renewed his sense of personal mission. Finally, Powell embarks on a search for the father he never really knew in a redemptive passage from abandonment to self-discovery. </p><p>A striking memoir by a child of post-Civil Rights America, <i>The Education of Kevin Powell</i> gives eloquent testimony to the power of the soul to heal. </p>";
