window.bookSummaryJSON = "In her new essay collection, the beloved author of <i>High Tide in Tucson</i> brings to us from one of history's darker moments an extended love song to the world we still have. From its opening parable gleaned from recent news about a lost child saved in an astonishing way, the book moves on to consider a world of surprising and hopeful prospects, ranging from an inventive conservation scheme in a remote jungle to the backyard flock of chickens tended by the author's small daughter. <p>These essays are grounded in the author's belief that our largest problems have grown from the earth's remotest corners as well as our own backyards, and that answers may lie in those places, too. In the voice Kingsolver's readers have come to rely on, sometimes grave, occasionally hilarious, and ultimately persuasive, <i>Small Wonder</i> is a hopeful examination of the people we seem to be, and what we might yet make of ourselves.</p>";
