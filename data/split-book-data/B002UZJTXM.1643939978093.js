window.bookSummaryJSON = "On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. <p>As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. <i>In Cold Blood</i> is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.</p>";
