window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Hamlet,</i> which dates from 1600-1601, is the first in Shakespeare's great series of four tragedies. In writing this extraordinary play, Shakespeare effectively re-invented tragedy after an interval of roughly 2,000 years - you would have to go back to the Greek dramatists of fifth century Athens to find anything of comparable depth and maturity. </p><p>This production features the voice of Anton Lesser as <i>Hamlet</i> along with a full cast.</p>";
