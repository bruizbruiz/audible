window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An exciting, eye-catching repackage of acclaimed author Walter Dean Myers' best-selling paperbacks, to coincide with the publication of <i>Sunrise Over Falluja</i> in hardcover. \"Those shackles didn't rob us of being black, son, they robbed us of being human.\" This is the story of one family. A family whose history saw its first ancestor captured, shackled, and brought to this country from Africa. A family who can still see remnants of the shackles that held some of its members captive - even today. It is a story of pride, determination, struggle, and love. And of the piece of the land that holds them together throughout it all.</p> <p></p>";
