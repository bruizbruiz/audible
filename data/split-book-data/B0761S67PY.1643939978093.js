At 20 \"Detroit Red\" was in prison. It was there Malcolm Little started the journey that would lead him to adopt the name Malcolm X, and develop his beliefs about what being black means in America: beliefs that shook America then, and still shake America today. His significant role in the Nation of Islam and eventual split from it, along with his journey to Mecca, followed by his assassination in Harlem are chronicled in this fascinating portrait.</p>";
